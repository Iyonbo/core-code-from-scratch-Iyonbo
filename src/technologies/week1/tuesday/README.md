## 1. Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages
<p>
We are going to explain the difference between the interpreted an compiled programming languages.</br>
In order to understand the differences, we have to know that every program is a set of instructions, this instructions are essential for the program to understand what it needs to do and how to do it. To that end the computer need to know the language of the instructions used.</br>
</p>
<b>Then, what's the difference?</b>
<p>
For instance, in the <b><i>compiled</b></i> language there's a program called "compiler" who recive a file in a specific language and he <b>translate</b> that filea creating anothe one, this second contains a translation from that specific language to a machine code. This one understandable for the machine.</br>
With this in mind, the machine can understand the new file that it recive and execute code that have the instructions within.</br>
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the <b><i>interpreted</b></i> language doesn't compile the file, it takes a copy of the file with the code and it's a program that read and execute the instructions in the code. This is translated on the go while it reads it, he translates it.
</p>

<p>
They're both used for the same outcome, to execute the instructions that are defined in the code. Yet they are used depending on the characteristicas of each. For instance, the <b><i>interpreted</b></i> execute the code for each line as it reads it. The flexibility it provides helps to make changes in the lines you want and the programming language identify it as it happens. However, the <b><i>compiled</b></i> programming language translate de instructions to machine code that the processor can execute, coupled with having mor control over hardware generally with de memory management. We get a faster execution and more efficient. Nevertheless, when we make a change the <b><i>compiler</b></i> will need to rebuild the program.
</p>

<p>
Here is a diagram that illustrate how each one works.</br>
