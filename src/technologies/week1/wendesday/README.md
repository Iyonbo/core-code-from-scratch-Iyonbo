## 1. Exercise. Your date of birth in the matrix

<p>
  <b>Binary</b> code is numbering scheme in wich there are only <b>1's</b> and <b>0's</b> and is the basis for evey computing systems. These systems use this code to understand operational intructions and user input and to present an output to the user. Computers represent numbers using binary code inside CPU and RAM. These digital numbers are electrical signals that are either on or off inside the CPU or RAM.<br><br>
  
  At this time, we know now what <b>binary</b> is and that it's possible to represent a decimal number in binary format. For the excercise we're going to find how our date of birth is in binary format. So let's begin.
</p>

<p>
  First and foremost, we define our date of birth. In my case it's July twenty-second of the year 1995.<br>
  With that in mind we proceed to find our date, first we begin with the month:
</p>
` Month: 7
  To Binary:
    2^0 = 1
    2^1 = 2
    2^2 = 4
      7-4 = 3
      3-2 = 1
      1-1 = 0
`
| Binary |
| ---------------------- |
| 128 |  64 |  32 |  16 |  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
